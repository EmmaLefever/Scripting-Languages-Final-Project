        "For my final project for Scripting Languages, I aim to explore the relationship between global economic development and fertility rates and life expectancy. This research aims to understand how a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and GDP growth rate influence these demographic factors, focusing on differences across various income groups: low, middle, and high-income countries.\n",

The second dataset focuses on GDP and GDP per capita in 244 countries, regions, or areas.\n",

Finally, I gave a name to the now first column (which was unnamed in the original files), namely 'Region/Country/Area' since it contains the names of the countries, regions, or areas in string format. Both files were then saved as CSV files (and can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/EmmaLefever/Scripting-Languages-Final-Project)).\n"

        "This output already reveals several insights about global demographic and economic indicators. The total fertility rate averages 2.74 children per woman, with a wide range (0 to 7.5), suggesting significant variation in birth rates across regions. Life expectancy at birth averages 71 years, with women typically living longer (mean 73.7 years) than men (mean 68.5 years). GDP per capita shows vast economic disparities, with an average of \\$14,993 but a standard deviation of \\$22,130, indicating a skewed distribution with extreme wealth in some areas (maximum $170,270). The real GDP growth rates also vary widely, from -36.1% to a growth of 43.5%."

        "The current analysis highlights the significant relationships between economic development, as measured by GDP per capita and GDP growth rates, and two key demographic indicators: fertility rates and life expectancy. Fertility rates decline as GDP per capita increases, with high-income countries exhibiting the lowest median fertility rate (1.6 children per woman) compared to the much higher rates observed in low-income countries (4.7 children per woman). Regression analysis confirmed this negative relationship, showing that even small increases in GDP per capita are associated with significant reductions in fertility. These findings could be explained by the demographic transition model, which links higher levels of economic development to improved education, urbanization, and access to family planning services, leading to lower fertility. However, the multivariate regression analysis presented a surprising result: GDP growth rates were positively and significantly associated with fertility rates. This stands in contrast to the negative relationship between GDP per capita and fertility. This could reflect the fact that GDP growth, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, might initially drive higher fertility due to improved child survival rates and economic optimism, while structural changes like widespread access to family planning lag behind. This finding suggests that short-term growth may not immediately lead to lower fertility.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, life expectancy shows a positive association with GDP per capita, rising significantly from a median of around 61 years in low-income countries to approximately 80 years in high-income nations. The regression results indicate that while GDP per capita strongly predicts life expectancy, GDP growth rates exhibit a small negative association. This suggests that rapid economic growth, particularly in lower-income settings, may not immediately translate into better health outcomes, as structural changes in healthcare and living standards often lag behind. Finally, statistical tests (ANOVA) confirmed significant differences in both fertility rates and life expectancy across income groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results reflect a narrative of demographic transition. Economic development fosters longer life expectancy through improved healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions, while simultaneously lowering fertility rates. However, the analysis also highlights persistent disparities between income groups. Middle-income countries show transitional trends, while low-income nations struggle with limited access to essential services. This sustains the trend in poorer countries of high fertility, since larger families often serve as a source of economic support, and lower life expectancy due to limited healthcare.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these insights, the current analysis has some limitations. The distribution of GDP per capita is highly skewed, with a small number of very wealthy countries influencing the results. Outliers in fertility and life expectancy also complicate the interpretation of trends. Additionally, the regression models suggest potential multicollinearity, which may affect the precision of coefficients. In the regression examining life expectancy, the Omnibus and Jarque-Bera tests also indicated significant deviations from normality in the residuals. This suggests that the ordinary least squares (OLS) model may not be the most suitable for this analysis. Alternative approaches, such as robust regression, quantile regression, or generalized additive models (GAMs), could better account for non-normality and non-linear relationships. Lastly, while the relationships observed are strong, the analysis cannot establish causality; for instance, lower fertility could also contribute to economic growth, rather than solely being a result of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the analysis demonstrates that economic development is closely tied to lower fertility rates and longer life expectancy. However, significant disparities persist across income groups, requiring targeted interventions to address underlying inequities. While economic growth remains an important driver of improved health and demographic outcomes, future research should incorporate additional variables (e.g., education levels) to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between economic and demographic factors."
